# Hometown Entropy

Landing page for WebGL JavaScript app that takes in multiple streams of data to create a grid of entropy changes. 

On one end of the grid is local changes and on the far end is global and even universal entropy - as measured by social media and physics constants. If web camera or touch screen enabled - the app can read in cursor movement or changes in color and motion from its environments. The app seeks to capture data at different scales, unite it, and portray our relationship to entropy, change, and disorder
